### xtUML Project Review Minutes

Reviewed: https://github.com/leviathan747/bridgepoint/blob/8417_oal_test/doc-bridgepoint/notes/8417_action_files/8417_action_files.md  996772c1 
Present:  Cort, Levi, Bob, Keith

<pre>

-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
_- 01  min   Bob  general  name .ant.md
x- 02  min   Bob  3        second sentence, refer to old editor work, multi-buffer editor work
x- 03  min   Cort 3        fourth sentence, add reference
x- 04  min   Cort 4        Add a new requirement to explore during the design phase to explore if partial model upgrade is supported or if we require a whole model to be converted
x- 05  min   Levi 5.3.1    Change "solution" to "task"
x- 06  min   Keith 5.4.2   Split this into 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.2.2
x- 07  min   Levi  5.4.3   This section is where John's comment about the signature editor comes into play
x- 08  min   Cort  5.4     There is a big decision here.  Do we want to do the proposed work as a baby step or does
    it make sense to hold off this work until we have full multi-buffer editor (perhaps with function signatures)?
        - This decision is deferred to the design note
x- 09  min   Keith 5.4     Extension should be 5.5
x- 10  min   Keith 5.4     Backwards compatibility should be 5.6
x- 11  min   Bob   5.6     Backwards compatibility sentence 3, reword
x- 12  min   Levi  5.6     Backwards compatibility, strike the "Completely removing ..." line
x- 13  min   Bob   6.9     strike this item (Load and Persist fulfills this role)
x- 14  min   Bob   7       Repeat each test scenario for each action home
x- 15  min   Bob   7.2     Note that editing the new activity only changes the new activity and doesn't touch the old one

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
