|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Operating System      | Windows 7/8/10, Linux variants       |
| *Eclipse              | Version 4.5                          |

General Notes
------
* A summary of the release highlights and new functionality is available on the 
[What's New](../WhatsNew/WhatsNew.html) page.  
  
* __IMPORTANT__: BridgePoint is completely open source software. 
Please see [xtUML.org](http://xtuml.org) and [onefact.net](http://onefact.net) 
for ongoing development and support of BridgePoint.  
  
* BridgePoint ships as a zip file, similar to standard eclipse packages. Users 
who wish to create desktop shortcuts to start BridgePoint should set the 
shortcut to start ```<install dir>/bridgepoint```.  

* BridgePoint 6.2 has enhanced support for modeling with the MASL action
language.  An Xtext-based editor provides syntax highlighting, validation
and context-sensitive edit assistance.  

* BridgePoint supports two different action languages: OAL and MASL.  The default
is set via workspace preferences at xtUML > Action Language > Default Action Language Dialect.
In this release the default is set to OAL.       
  
Interoperability with Previous Releases
------
BridgePoint 6.2 is compatible with workspaces and projects created with prior 
versions back to BridgePoint 5.0.  However, after opening the model in this version
a modeler will not be able to open the model in a prior version.   

Issues and Feature Requests
------
The BridgePoint support system is hosted at [http://support.onefact.net](http://support.onefact.net).
